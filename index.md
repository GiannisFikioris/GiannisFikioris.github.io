I am a graduate of the department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National Technical University of Athens. I completed my thesis with [Dimitris Fotakis](http://www.softlab.ntua.gr/~fotakis/), titled [Perturbation Stability for Mechanism Design](http://artemis.cslab.ece.ntua.gr:8080/jspui/bitstream/123456789/17435/1/Giannis%20Fikioris%20Thesis.pdf).

At the moment and up until August 2020, I will be working in [NCSR "Demokritos"](http://www.demokritos.gr/), and in particular in the [Complex Event Recognition Group](http://cer.iit.demokritos.gr/), advised by [Alexander Artikis](http://users.iit.demokritos.gr/~a.artikis/).

My interests lay in Algorithmic Game Theory, and more specifically in Mechanism Design, as well as Learning Theory.

### Work Experience

- **July 19' to August 20'** - Working as a Research Associate in the [Complex Event Recognition Group](http://cer.iit.demokritos.gr/) of [NCSR "Demokritos"](http://www.demokritos.gr/). More specifically, I am working on an algorithm that compresses the route of a ship, to make a simpler trajectory with less points. This allows a complex event recognition engine ([RTEC](http://cer.iit.demokritos.gr/RTEC/)) to identify various events more quickly and accurate.
