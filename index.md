## About me

I am a graduate of the department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National Technical University of Athens. I completed my thesis with [Dimitris Fotakis](http://www.softlab.ntua.gr/~fotakis/), with name [Perturbation Stability for Mechanism Design](http://artemis.cslab.ece.ntua.gr:8080/jspui/bitstream/123456789/17435/1/Giannis%20Fikioris%20Thesis.pdf).

From July of 2019 to August 2020 I will be working in [NCSR "Demokritos"](http://www.demokritos.gr/), and in particular in the [Complex Event Recognition Group](http://cer.iit.demokritos.gr/), advised by [Alexander Artikis](http://users.iit.demokritos.gr/~a.artikis/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/GiannisFikioris/GiannisFikioris.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
